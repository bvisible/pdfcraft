# Neoffice fork markers

Map of **our** divergence from upstream (`storytold/pdfcraft`) in this fork (`bvisible/pdfcraft`, branch
`version-15`). Everything that can carry a comment carries a `//// Neoffice — …` marker in place:
`// //// Neoffice — …` in Rust (a bare `////` is an error for clippy), `# //// Neoffice — …` in TOML
and YAML, `<!-- //// Neoffice — … -->` in Markdown. This file holds the base of the divergence and
what cannot carry a comment.

At the next upstream merge, `grep -rn "////"` in the source plus this file give the complete
picture of what is ours and why.

- **Upstream**: `storytold/pdfcraft`, branch `main`.
- **Base of the divergence**: `7163ba3dee8becfff6871c9a65d0d8314314742b`, the tag `v0.7.1`, where `version-15` was cut on 2026-10-13.
  Move it at each upstream merge. The check works it out itself (the common ancestor with
  upstream's `main`), so this line is for the reader.

## What the fork adds

Three workflow files, all new files that carry their own `//// Neoffice — added file` header. No
file of upstream's is changed.

- `.github/workflows/neoffice-web.yml`: builds the browser version on a GitHub runner, started by
  hand, with the packaging script upstream's own release job runs. Upstream's workflows are
  disabled on this fork, because they need upstream's signing secrets.
- `.github/workflows/neoffice-markers.yml`: fails a push to `version-15` when a change to
  upstream's code since the common ancestor carries no marker.
- `.github/workflows/neoffice-ci.yml`: runs upstream's whole quality gate, `cargo xtask ci`, in one
  job on a GitHub runner (by hand, or on a push that touches code), because the maintainer's Mac has
  too little disk to run it for every change.

## Files that cannot carry a comment

None so far.
